# computational_camera_phase_retrieval
We use a reflective phase-only liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM) for phase modulation. By encoding a grayscale image on the SLM, the refractive index of each cell can be altered. Phase patterns of PSFs with different shapes are optimized by the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm.
